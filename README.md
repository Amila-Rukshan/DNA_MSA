## Human Computing Game for solving multiple sequence alignment of biological sequences

It needs higher computing capabilities to align multiple sequences of DNA. But this can be easily done through crowdsourcing. One way is by the development of human-computing games, which allows players to align those sequences under a given evaluating criteria. Sometimes human’s visual intuition can outperform alignments done by heuristics algorithms.

In this project the main task is to build such a game so that it can align multiple such sequences. If a player’s score is higher than score from a heuristic algorithm, then that alignments are significant. These MSA can aid genetic disease researches. As some examples researches on Cancers, Heart and Muscle diseases, Metabolic diseases, Brain nervous and sensory system diseases. By this way anyone who plays this game ultimately contributes to the benefit of the humanity.

Following are some snapshots of the game.
